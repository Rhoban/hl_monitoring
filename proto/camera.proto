/**
 * This file describes the principal messages used for describing Camera
 * properties and Pose for videos
 *
 * All notations are based on OpenCV formalism for Intrinsic and Extrinsic
 * parameters of the camera: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.5/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html
 *
 * The field referential is defined as follows:
 * - Zero: Center of field at ground level
 * - X-axis goes from center to opposite goal
 * - Y-axis goes from center toward left side of the field while facing opposite goal
 * - Z-axis points toward the roof
 *
 * The camera referential is defined as follows:
 * - Zero: At camera optical center
 * - X-axis: aligned with x-axis of the image
 * - Y-axis: aligned with y-axis of the image
 * - Z-axis: direction toward which the camera is pointing
